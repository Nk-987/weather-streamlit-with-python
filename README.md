# weather-streamlit-with-python
A real-time, interactive weather dashboard built using Python and Streamlit. This app allows users to enter a city name and get real-time weather updates, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, for the next 12 to 48 hours. The data is pulled from the Open-Meteo API, with city name geolocation provided by Nominatim (OpenStreetMap).
